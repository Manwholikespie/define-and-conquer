#Define and Conquer
####*by Manwholikespie*.

Greetings, and hello. This is another script that I use during some school assignments, namely on worksheets that require me to define lots of terms. Basically, this program searches for a word on wikipedia and returns the first 5 sentences of its introduction.  

## Installation
### Dependencies
The [wikipedia](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wikipedia/) module.  

To install it:  
`pip install wikipedia`

## Usage
Type in the terms you wish to define in the "terms.txt" file.  
Execute with:  
`python DaC.py`

## Special Thanks
To Wikipedia (for providing the data).  
To Jonathan Goldsmith for making the wikipedia module.
